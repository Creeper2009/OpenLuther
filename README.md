## OpenLuther
OpenLuther is an operating system for the [OpenComputers](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers) mod that is also a challenging unix hacking game. This is an extremely early release, forked directly from [OpenOS](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master/src/main/resources/assets/opencomputers/loot/OpenOS). There are no actual gameplay elements yet.

The "floppy" directory is the source code of OpenLuther. It is a bootable floppy disk.
